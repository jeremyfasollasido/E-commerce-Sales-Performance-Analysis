## Project Description

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce sales performance, aiming to extract crucial insights from online retail transaction data. By understanding sales trends, top-selling products, and customer behavior, this project provides actionable strategic recommendations to enhance operational efficiency and marketing strategies.

An interactive dashboard has been built using Streamlit to visualize the findings in a clean and intuitive manner, making it a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making.

## Key Features & Insights

* **Sales Trends Over Time:** Analysis of monthly, daily (by day of week), and hourly sales to identify peak selling periods.
* **Product Performance:** Identification of top-selling and highest-revenue-generating products.
* **Customer & Geographical Analysis:** Understanding of customer distribution and sales contributions from various countries.
* **Business Recommendations:** Data-backed strategic advice for seasonal optimization, promotion of star products, timely marketing strategies, international market expansion, customer loyalty programs, and inventory management.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Online Retail Dataset**, containing transactional data from a UK-based online retail store over a specific period. This dataset was originally obtained from Kaggle.
*(If you converted the original "Online Retail.xlsx" to "data.csv", you can mention that here, e.g., "The original data was in .xlsx format and converted to `data.csv` for this project.")*

## Technologies & Tools

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical computing.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For static data visualization and exploration.
* **Streamlit:** For building interactive web dashboards and presenting insights.
* **Git & GitHub:** For version control and code hosting.

## How to Run the Application Locally

To run this dashboard on your local machine, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/ecommerce-dashboard-streamlit.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/ecommerce-dashboard-streamlit.git)
    cd ecommerce-dashboard-streamlit
    ```
    *(Replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username.)*

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    It is highly recommended to isolate project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    # For Windows:
    .\myenv\Scripts\activate
    # For macOS/Linux:
    # source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure your virtual environment is active, then install all required libraries from `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Prepare the Dataset:**
    * Download the `data.csv` file from [this dataset page on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrieok/ecommerce-data) (or from your repository if you've already uploaded it there).
    * Ensure the `data.csv` file is placed inside the `data` folder within your repository (`ecommerce-dashboard-streamlit/data/data.csv`).

5.  **Run the Streamlit Application:**
    Navigate your terminal into the `data` folder inside your repository:
    ```bash
    cd data
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The application should automatically open in your web browser (typically at `http://localhost:8501`).
